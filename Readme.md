A modern, feature-rich timer management application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This application allows users to create, manage, and track multiple timers with category organization, progress tracking, and customizable alerts.


## Features

- Create multiple timers with custom names and durations
- Organize timers by categories
- Track progress with visual indicators
- Dark/Light theme support
- Responsive design
- Halfway and completion notifications
- Export timer data
- Timer history tracking
- Bulk actions for category management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Timer.git
cd Timer


2. Install dependencies:
bash
npm install


3. Start the development server:
bash
npm run dev


4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

bash
npm run build


The built files will be in the dist directory.

## Development Assumptions

### State Management
- Local storage is used for persistence instead of a backend database
- Timer state is managed using React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- All timer operations are performed client-side

### Browser Support
- Modern browser features are required:
  - localStorage for data persistence
  - Notification API for timer alerts
  - CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
  - ES6+ JavaScript features

### User Experience
- Users want to organize timers by categories
- Visual feedback is important for timer status
- Users need bulk actions for managing multiple timers
- Dark/light theme preference should persist
- Timer data should be exportable

### Performance
- Timer updates occur every second
- Local storage operations are minimal
- Component re-renders are optimized
- Assets are loaded lazily when possible

### Security
- No sensitive data is stored
- Timer data is stored locally
- No authentication required
